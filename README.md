# ChatRoom - A Real-Time Messaging Application in C\#

## Overview

ChatRoom is a real-time messaging application built with C# that features a user-friendly graphical interface (UI) and operates on a server-client architecture. It enables instant communication between multiple users while ensuring secure message transmission through encoding, decoding, and encryption techniques.

This project serves as an excellent learning opportunity for computer science students, offering hands-on experience with network programming, socket communication, data serialization, and encryption methods. It is a fun yet fundamental project that strengthens your understanding of real-world client-server applications.

## Features

✅ **Real-Time Messaging** - Instantly send and receive messages across connected clients.\
✅ **Server-Client Architecture** - The system is built on a structured server-client model.\
✅ **User-Friendly UI** - A Windows Forms or WPF-based interface for seamless communication.\
✅ **Message Encoding & Decoding** - Ensures proper message formatting and data integrity.\
✅ **Secure Communication** - Uses encryption techniques to protect network packets.\
✅ **Scalability** - Can be extended to support multiple clients concurrently.\
✅ **Logging System** - Tracks user activity for debugging and security purposes.

## Technology Stack

### Languages & Frameworks:

- C# (.NET Framework or .NET Core)
- Windows Forms (WinForms) or WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)
- Socket Programming (System.Net.Sockets)

### Networking & Security:

- TCP/IP Socket Communication
- Custom Message Protocol for Encoding & Decoding
- AES/RSA Encryption for Secure Transmission

### Data Handling:

- JSON/XML Serialization for Message Exchange
- Multi-threading for Asynchronous Communication

## Architecture

The ChatRoom application follows a **server-client model**, where:

- The **server** manages client connections, relays messages, and ensures encrypted communication.
- The **client** connects to the server, sends messages, and displays incoming messages via the UI.

### Data Flow

1. **Client sends a message** → Encodes and encrypts the data.
2. **Server receives the packet** → Decrypts and decodes the message.
3. **Server relays the message** → Sends it securely to the intended recipients.
4. **Client receives and displays the message**.

## Installation & Setup

### Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ChatRoom.git
cd ChatRoom
```

### Build the Project

Open the project in **Visual Studio** and build the solution.

### Run the Server

1. Navigate to the `Server` folder.
2. Run the `ChatServer.exe` (or execute it via Visual Studio).

### Run the Client

1. Navigate to the `Client` folder.
2. Run `ChatClient.exe` (or execute it via Visual Studio).
3. Enter the server IP and connect.

## Future Improvements

🚀 **Cross-Platform Compatibility** - Extend support for macOS and Linux clients.\
🚀 **Database Integration** - Store chat history using SQL or NoSQL databases.\
🚀 **File Sharing** - Enable users to send and receive files.\
🚀 **Voice & Video Calls** - Implement VoIP communication using WebRTC.\
🚀 **Mobile App Support** - Develop Android/iOS versions using Xamarin or MAUI.
